## QA Automation Assignment

Thank you for your interest in the role at Noble.

We hope the test will not only test your abilities but also give you a little glimpse into some
of the tasks we carry out. You are welcome to use any resources that would be available to
you during the course of a normal day at Noble: e.g. Google is permitted, as are textbooks,
however use of existing code libraries or non-licensable proprietary software you have used
anywhere else would not be allowed.

One final word of warning - at Noble you will regularly gather your own requirements directly
or receive vague details by email. Sometimes it is not possible to get a very detailed
specification simply because the user doesn’t know or isn’t available. When this
happens you have to use your initiative and work things out for yourself. This test has several
ambiguities and vague definitions. It is up to you to make reasonable and valid assumptions.
Do not ask your recruitment consultant for help or advice as they know no more than you do.

And one final tip: KISS – Keep It Short and Simple. Don’t overcomplicate the solution, keep it simple,
efficient and easy to maintain.

### Problem statement

Create a full stack test automation framework for continuous integration of any front-end application codebase.

#### Detailed Requirements

1) Create a CentOS server VM in any IAAS cloud environment (DigitalOcean or AWS EC2 preferred) - no PAAS like GAE or Heroku. Alternatively you are more than welcome to create a VM on your local machine using tools like VirtualBox and Vagrant and put the image for us to download from a secure public file server.

2) Install and configure a continuous integration suite - again as Atlassian lovers, we prefer you download 30 day trial version of Bamboo and configure it. However you are more than welcome to use Jenkins or a similar tool for this purpose.

3) Setup a UI testing plan for front-end testing - the tools we'd like you to put together would be based on the modern web stack including but not limited to Node.js, Bower, Grunt and Karma.

4) As final icing on the cake, you can configure the test plan to hit any of open-source public front-end projects like Backbone.js, AngularJS or Twitter Bootstrap or any other modern framework.

Many thanks for taking your time to complete this exercise. Wish you good luck.
